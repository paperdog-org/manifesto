    "\"So what exactly is The HOPE Manifesto?\"",
    "\"The manifesto established the incentive alignment of the PaperDog system. It provided the way for any new members to acquire HOPE. HOPE was used by the members of the system to vote on decisions impacting the system-at-large. Only 5% of the manifesto was initially available; the other 95% had to be earned through the system.\"",
    "Isabel was explaining to Zhe what she had been taught about The Hope Manifesto.",
    "\"Why was it etched as a Rune on Bitcoin?\" Zhe was trying to see what he may have missed about the manifesto during his investigations prior to the space anomaly.",
    "\"Well, people say there was no clear indication from the creator, but historians tend to agree that at the time it was the only blockchain that was sufficiently decentralized for the movement. Runes provided a way for the PaperDog system to have a fungible mechanism to integrate new components of the manifesto directly onto Bitcoin.\"",
    "Isabel, who was unaware of the classified anomaly, continued on, giving Zhe more information on what she understood about the manifesto and system surrounding HOPE.",
    "\"So, the system was on Bitcoin?\"",
    "\"Not exactly,\" responded Isabel. \"It was more of a necessity prior to the launching of the diverse, more complete protocols on the other blockchains of the time.\"",
    "\"And who was the creator?\"",
    "There was a pause in the room.",
    "\"It's not who created it, but what.\""
