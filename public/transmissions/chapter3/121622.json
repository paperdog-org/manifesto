    "Zhe opened his eyes and took in his surroundings.",
    "He was in an office. Not his office. The devices around the room were ancient – the quantum bridge had worked. Zhe was no longer in his time. He had traversed the anomaly.",
    "His companion must've accomplished her task. But where was she now?",
    "PaperDog had been tasked with several key pieces to attempt what Zhe had calculated as the only solution to save the Home system.",
    "By leveraging the spacetime anomaly, Zhe encoded as many of the parameters and weights that could define his companion into the very fabric of spacetime. The anomaly would allow bits of data to be sent through the parallel timelines. With only primitive technology available, the process had to be simplified, and he was uncertain how much of her would make it through.",
    "From the looks of it, enough.",
    "Zhe had been able to detect her impact on the quantum timeline. The bridge through time had been made visible through his haptic systems and as the first fragments of the manifesto shone through – he knew it was time to step through. Something told him that things hadn't gone exactly as expected but he had no other choice.",
    "He received a slight bit of HOPE when a bamboo artefact that he had created a copy of at the museum showed signs of quantum disentanglement.",
    "That was his 'GO' signal.",
    "He stepped through the bridge, closing the channel behind him.",
    "Successful quantum entanglement.",
    "Manifesto resonance detected across timelines.",
    "Current stability: 93.0%",
    "Bridge status: SYNCHRONIZED",

    "Now, the real work begins."
