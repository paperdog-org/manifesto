                <b>PaperDog</b> is a story about <b>HOPE</b>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <b>HOPE</b> is a measure of contribution to the shared ethos of <b>PaperDog</b> 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                You can debate amongst yourselves on what <b>HOPE</b> means, but we believe that <b>HOPE</b> is an underlying idea that must be a part of life to be successful. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <b>HOPE</b> is both the earliest and most essential virtue inherent to life. It is the one thing that we must have when we have nothing else.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <b>HOPE</b> pushes people to do unimaginable things.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <b>HOPE</b> is the single theme that unites all of our pasts, presents, and futures.

            <div>
                Here are the 3 ways <b>HOPE</b> will be available:
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                1. <b>CLAIMING</b>: <b>HOPE</b> claimed at market value
                <br />
                2. <b>GIVING</b>: <b>HOPE</b> given at <b>PaperDog</b> value
                <br />
                3. <b>SELF-STAKING</b>: <b>HOPE</b> claimed or given at market or <b>PaperDog</b> value respectively
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>HOPE</b> can always be claimed but it can't always be given.
                <br />
                <br />
                The market value of <b>HOPE</b> is 100.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>PaperDog</b> value is the market value of <b>HOPE</b> when <b>PaperDog</b> last closed.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>PaperDog</b> closes once every day and night.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>PaperDog</b> value can only be determined before closing if there is an earlier commitment to an outcome. In this scenario, <b>PaperDog</b> value would be calculated based on the real and simulated blocks before closing:

            </div>
            <br />
            <hr className="dashed w-full opacity-80"></hr>
            <br />
            <div>
                With <b>CLAIMING</b>, <b>HOPE</b> can be claimed at the current market value of <b>HOPE</b>
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>HOPE</b> can be claimed whenever but when <b>HOPE</b> is claimed it is gone forever.
                <br />
                <br />
                So choose when you claim <b>HOPE</b> wisely.
                <br />
                <br />
                How <b>HOPE</b> can be claimed can change. So keep that in mind.
            </div>
            <br />
            <hr className="dashed w-full opacity-80"></hr>
            <br />
            <div>
                With <b>GIVING</b>, <b>HOPE</b> is given at the <b>PaperDog</b> value set at the last closing.
                <br />
                <br />
                When <b>HOPE</b> can be given can change, and it can't always be given.
            </div>
            <br />
            <hr className="dashed w-full opacity-80"></hr>
            <br />
            <div>
                With <b>SELF-STAKING</b>, <b>HOPE</b> can either be claimed or given.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>HOPE</b> is accrued for each block that a token is held by a <b>PaperDog</b>. 
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>HOPE</b>, in this context, is a measure of your <b>PaperDog</b> participation equal to the time-integrated held <b>HOPE</b> units of BTC/ETH/SOL ⋅ hours.
                <br />
                <br />
                A <b>HOPE</b> unit is equivalent to 0.01 BTC, 0.1 ETH, and 1 SOL per day or night held. 
                <br />
                <br />
                There is a 2x multiplier for every 40 full day and nights held
                <br />
                <br />
                There is also a bonus of 100 <b>HOPE</b> for every full day and night held. 
                <br />
                <br />
                For example, a <b>PaperDog</b> who self-stakes 0.1 BTC, 1 ETH, and 10 SOL for a full 40 days and 40 nights would accrue 100000 <b>HOPE</b> over this time period:
                <br />
                <br />
                    <div className = 'text-center text-bold'><b>
                        (10 BTC units x 10 ETH units x 10 SOL units × 40 days × 40 nights x 2) = 96000 <b>HOPE</b>
                        <br />
                        + 
                        <br />
                        (100 HOPE x 40 full day and night) = 4000 HOPE
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        TOTAL = 100000 <b>HOPE</b>
                    </b></div>
                <br />
                <br />
                Now, that's real <b>HOPE</b>
            </div>
            <br />
            <hr className="dashed w-full opacity-80"></hr>
            <br />
            <div>
                You may think that claiming <b>HOPE</b> has more benefits.
                <br />
                <br />
                But, we believe that giving <b>HOPE</b> is infinitely more powerful. 
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>HOPE</b> given can make all of our dreams come true.
            </div>
