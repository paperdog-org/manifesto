                    The Manifesto is how you gain access to the PaperDog experience.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    One of the most difficult aspects of engaging with crypto is that one must be able to secure their own private keys. 
                    <br /> <br /> 
                    If the keys are lost, one loses access to their assets and funds. 
                    <br /> 
                    <br /> 
                    As of 2024, the most user friendly way to store private keys is through <u>seed phrases</u>. 
                    <br /> 
                    <br /> 
                    Essentially, you get a cool set of 12 to 24 words that work like a password to give you access to crypto. 
                    <br /><br />
                    In practice, it can be done using almost any phrase, but the seed phrase is used to ensure that the odds of identifying those exact words in the correct order would be almost entirely impossible - at least in a probabilistic sense. 
                    <br />
                    <br /> 
                    For example, the odds of guessing a 12-word seed phrase is 1 in 5,444,517,870,735,015,415,413,993,718,908,291,383,296.
                    <br /> 
                    <br /> 
                    I won't write down the odds of guessing a 24-word seed phrase because it'd be about the same odds as correctly picking a single atom in the universe.
                    <br /> 
                    <br /> 
                    Crazy how math works sometimes.
                    <br /> 
                    <br /> 
                    <br /> 
                    Most crypto wallets use seed phrases 
                    including MetaMask, Phantom, and Leather as well as hardware wallets like Trezor and Ledger.
                    <br /> 
                    <br /> 
                    PaperDog also uses seed phrases, but it is called The Manifesto.
                    <br /> 
                    <br /> 
                    The Manifesto is not just a seed phrase.
                    <br /> 
                    <br /> 
                    Yes, a 24-word seed phrase is generated as The Manifesto.
                    <br /> 
                    <br /> 
                    But, The Manifesto can be anything that is sufficiently random. 
                    <br /> 
                    <br /> 
                    And, The Manifesto can even be recovered if saved.

                    we recommend writing it down by hand with a paper and pen but you can do whatever you want.
